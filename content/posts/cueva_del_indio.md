• Located not too far away from San Juan, La Cueva del Indio is a magical place. There’s an entrance fee that is not too expensive but any local would know that if you park just a little bit ahead of the main parking you can walk by the beach and enter the cave. It’s an easy 8-minute hike to the top and aside from an amazing view you’ll get to admire the stalactites, stalagmites, bats, and the sight of the ocean’s waves constantly beating the rocks.
