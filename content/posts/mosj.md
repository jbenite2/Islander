â€¢ Built relatively recently in 2015, the Mall of San Juan is the home to more than 100 stores including Zara, Banana Republic, Urban Outfitters, Victoriaâ€™s Secret, Hollister, Vans, among others. Its third level has a series of restaurants that are very good. Iâ€™d recommend Vinâ€™us, Metropol, and Tijuanaâ€™s. The gelato store that is also located in the third floor is exquisite. There is live music occasionally in the terrace as well as an amazing view of the San Jose lake.
