• Isla Verde, similarly to Condado, is one of my go-to beaches. On one side you have Pine Grove and on the other you have Hobbie. They’re both equally as good and provide the perfect environment for a chill day with family and friends. On the Hobbie side where a lot of hotels are located, jet skis and banana boats can be rented. The Pine Grove side is more relax and often visited by locals. Near the end you can find a Beach Club called Vivo. A lot of beach volleyball tournaments are hosted in Pine Groves. With a little bit of research, you could also find times to experience a turtle walk in front of the Marriot at night.
