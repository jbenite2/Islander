‚Ä¢ A fan of a night life myself, don‚Äôt be surprised if you run into me at ‚ÄúPlaci‚Äù. La Placita de Santurce offers a unique experience to anyone who is looking for a good time on a Friday or Saturday night. It‚Äôs a square full of bars, clubs, and speakeasies. From ‚ÄúSaque‚Äù shots in the Japanese bar to salsa in the main square, La Placita is a thrilling experience. More than just a place to hang out, it‚Äôs a culturally rich location that lights up during the day functioning as the central marketplace of the area.[üß≠](https://www.google.com/maps/place/La+Placita+de+Santurce/@18.4505721,-66.0727097,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x8c036f3622f0fb09:0x4ef895f0b6b84e65!8m2!3d18.4505721!4d-66.070521)
