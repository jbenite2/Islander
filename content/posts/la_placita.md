• A fan of a night life myself, don’t be surprised if you run into me at “Placi”. La Placita de Santurce offers a unique experience to anyone who is looking for a good time on a Friday or Saturday night. It’s a square full of bars, clubs, and speakeasies. From “Saque” shots in the Japanese bar to salsa in the main square, La Placita is a thrilling experience. More than just a place to hang out, it’s a culturally rich location that lights up during the day functioning as the central marketplace of the area.
