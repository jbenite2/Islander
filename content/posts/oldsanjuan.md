• I decided not to assign a tag to this spot because you can't limit this magical place to simply one category. Instead what I'll do is break down this "islote" (tiny island), called Old San Juan, by parts. [🧭](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Viejo+San+Juan,+San+Juan/@18.4645619,-66.124844,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x8c036eb8b656b379:0x86bd62881c6ab915!8m2!3d18.463203!4d-66.1147571)

• Old San Juan is a tiny island seperated from the main land. El Puente Dos Hermanos is the only way to get to the island by ground transportation. It passes over the La Laguna de Condado, a pond where you can kayak, paddle board, amongst other things.

• Once you pass the bridges and are driving to the top, you'll see to a series of hotel buildings and food places. Eventually you'll see to your right a soccer stadium. On the other side of the stadium there is a beautiful beach called Escambron. It is also a windy, refreshing spot.

• Keep driving further up and on the right you'll see that a green passage meant for cyclers starts. This is a stretch frequented not only by cyclist, but also by skateboaers, runners, and tourists. Personally, I'm a big fan of waking up early in the morning and going along for a jog in Old San Juan. The route's landscape is mesmerizing and the temperature in the morning feels refreshing.
