• I was basically raised at Condado. It’s not unusual for me to meet my friends at Ocean Park, the area where the beach is located, for a day full of music, spikeball, beach tennis, calisthenics, and relaxing. You can also spend the day surfing and kite surfing in this area. After the beach there are multiple places to go grab a bite at. Some of my favorite ones are Buns, Ponte Fresco, Marco’s Pizza, Crush, TresBe, and Pinky’s.
