â€¢ Ecoâ€™s is an entertainment hub. It counts with dining stations, two bars, three indoor soccer fields, two beach volleyball (and beach tennis) spaces, two basketball (and volleyball) courts, and squash spaces. Itâ€™s a place to hangout with good vibes and quality music. Whether itâ€™s watching a the NBA playoffs in the big screen or attending the Fortnite tournaments hosted in the play room, itâ€™s always a great time. Ecoâ€™s usually hosts live music and events. It has a very central location so Iâ€™d say youâ€™re pretty close to it no matter where youâ€™re staying. Make sure to call and reserve a space with time if youâ€™re interested in playing sports.
