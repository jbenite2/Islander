â€¢ "La Pecera" or The Fish Tank is a place of peace and tranquility where one can enjoy marine life without the stress of dangerous currents or the open sea. It is very convenient to get there as there is parking available (costs $5). Many people park at the first parking lot and end up going to EscambrÃ³n Beach(#8). To get to the La Pecera(#9), a neighboring beach that is much calmer, keep following the guide and park at the furthest parking lot located to the left of "Playa 9" in the image below (next to the palm trees). Here you can go diving, relax after a long run in San Juan, or simply hang out with the fish in the natural pool. This is undoubtedly my parents' favorite. Here are the directions: [ðŸ§­](https://www.google.com/maps/place/La+Pecera/@18.4654835,-66.0887081,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x8c036fba6ac85693:0x18529dca6b6b79db!8m2!3d18.4654784!4d-66.0861332!16s%2Fg%2F11p6g7z7vz?entry=ttu)
