â€¢ El Yunque is the only Rain Forrest in U.S. territory. Having visited el Yunque more than 20 times myself, I can speak about it's magic and splendor. El Yunque is the place to go if you're looking for an adventure. It has hike's that go from anywhere in the 15 minute range to an 8 hours range. People frequent El Yunque to admire Puerto Rican flora and fauna. and click here : [ðŸ§­](https://www.google.com/maps/place/El+Yunque+National+Forest/@18.2951346,-65.8045174,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x8c04a1b32efdd0c9:0x8342f6bc9bb224d1!8m2!3d18.2951347!4d-65.8000327).
