• Right after the Cueva del Indio me and my friends would take time to cool off and relax in the long stretch of beach known as Playa Caza y Pesca. This beach leads to La Poza del Obispo, a small, very relaxing cove. Not a lot of people frequent this beach and that’s one of the reasons I love it. There’s always something new to explore and not to mention the jaw dropping sunsets seen from anywhere along the stretch. If you’re in the Arecibo area or are looking for a good beach to do a road trip to, set the GPS to “Playa La Poza del Obispo, Arecibo.”
