â€¢ Coming back to Puerto Rico from college, "Metropol" is the obvious answer when my parents ask me where I want to go eat. After eating dining hall food for 4 months, my body craves un "arrocito con habichuelas bien rico"(A good plate of rice and beans). Metropol will serve all the Puerto Rican main dishes. Even though my go to is the Metropol near the airport, there are a handful of locations around the island. If you came all the way to Puerto Rico you have to try our food (It's delicious). Metropol is the place to go.
