â€¢ Arena is a relatively new sports bar located in District Live. This is probably the best sports bar I've been to in PR. It counts with three bars, two pool tables, and one pingpong table. Aside from this it has quite a few plasmas and 1 mega tv. The environment that forms at Arena Medalla when game day comes around is unreal. Sports unite people and Arena is the perfect place to come together to enjoy these moments.
