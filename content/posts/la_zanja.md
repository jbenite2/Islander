â€¢ After several attempts to reach this place, tempted to stay longer at the beautiful spots we found along the way, we finally arrived at the location known as La Zanja. To reach La Zanja, we skirted the heads of San Juan, and after a walk of about 2 miles, we arrived at this hidden place with crystal clear water and the appearance of a natural Jacuzzi. Did you know they also call it "La Chiva Natural"? It's a natural pool facing the ocean. It's important to know that you have to climb and descend rocks, you can't reach it by car, and it's approximately a 50-minute walk or 4km, so pack lightly! Here are directions for it:  [ðŸ§­](https://www.google.com/maps/place/La+Zanja+Natural+(Sea+Pool)/@18.3875691,-65.6251101,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x8c0491ae2f0812c9:0xe2a83b7d312b9a4d!8m2!3d18.387564!4d-65.6225352!16s%2Fg%2F11twrdgfbr?entry=ttu)
