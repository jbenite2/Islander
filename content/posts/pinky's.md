â€¢ Pinky's is 100% my favorite breakfast place in Puerto Rico. There are two locations near Condado, a beach a frequent regularly. The vibe in the breakfast & brunch restaurant is incredibly relax and chill. My go-to order is a Mallorca Breakfast Sandwich with any The Classic smoothie. It's amazing! Head over to Pinky's if you're in the area.
