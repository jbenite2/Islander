â€¢ Did you know the biggest mall in the Caribbean is located in San Juan, Puerto Rico? More than 300 stores are located in [Plaza las Americas](https://www.plazalasamericas.com/). I guarentee you'll walk out with what you were looking for after going to "Plaza", as it is called by many. My favorite locations in "Plaza" are [Caribbean Cinemas](https://caribbeancinemas.com/theater/plaza-las-americas/), [PF Changs](https://www.pfchangspr.com/restaurantes/), and [Ponte Fresco](https://www.facebook.com/PonteFrescoPR/).
