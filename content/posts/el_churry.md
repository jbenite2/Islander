• After a long day at the beach, a road trip around the island, or coming back from La Placita at 3am, there’s nothing like a good “Churry”. This Puerto Rican sandwich food-truck chain’s reputation proceeds it. I definitely recommend going to “El Churry” at some point of your stay at Puerto Rico. It’s like nothing you’ve ever had.
